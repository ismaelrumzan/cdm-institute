title: "Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent"
description: "Learn to build intelligent AI agents using RAG architecture. You will combine the power of vector embeddings, semantic search, and large language models to create context-aware AI assistants that can learn and retrieve information dynamically."
---

## What You'll Build

Throughout this program, you'll build a production-ready RAG agent using the [Vercel AI SDK RAG Starter](https://github.com/vercel/ai-sdk-rag-starter) repository. You'll learn to ingest documents, create vector embeddings, implement semantic search, and generate contextually relevant responses using OpenAI's models.

<Callout>
  This learning path is designed for developers familiar with React and
  TypeScript, but new to Next.js, Vercel, and AI development. No prior
  experience with these technologies is required.
</Callout>

## Learning Outcomes

- **Build production-ready RAG agents** using Vercel AI SDK and Next.js 14
- **Understand vector embeddings and semantic search** with practical implementations
- **Implement document ingestion and processing pipelines** with automatic embedding generation
- **Create responsive chat interfaces** with real-time streaming and tool visualization
- **Deploy and scale AI applications** on Vercel with PostgreSQL and pgvector
- **Build AI tool integration** for dynamic knowledge base management
