## Core Next.js App Router Architecture

### File-Based Routing System

Understanding Next.js App Router's file-based routing system is fundamental to migrating from React Router.

<Accordion title="Learn about File-Based Routing System">
  <FileBasedRoutingBasics />
</Accordion>

**Key Concepts You'll Need:**

- Route segments and special files
- Dynamic routes with `[param]` syntax
- Route groups with `(group)` syntax
- Navigation with `Link` and `useRouter`

### Server and Client Components

The distinction between server and client components is crucial for optimal Next.js performance.

<Accordion title="Server and Client Components">
  <ServerClientComponentsBasics />
</Accordion>

**Key Concepts You'll Need:**

- Server components for data fetching and static content
- Client components for interactivity and browser APIs
- The `'use client'` directive
- Component composition patterns

### Layouts

Creating consistent UI patterns with layouts.

<Accordion title="Layouts">
  <LayoutsBasics />
</Accordion>

**Key Concepts You'll Need:**

- Root layout for global UI
- Nested layouts for section-specific UI
- Layout hierarchy and composition
- Basic layout patterns

### Loading States

Providing better user experience with loading states.

<Accordion title="Loading States">
  <LoadingStatesBasics />
</Accordion>

**Key Concepts You'll Need:**

- `loading.tsx` for loading states
- Basic skeleton loading patterns
- Nested loading states
- Loading state best practices

## Additional Resources

For more advanced concepts like streaming, suspense, concurrent features, and error boundaries, refer to the comprehensive snippets in later modules.

## VSL Service Center Context

### Project Structure Analysis

Before starting the migration tasks, familiarize yourself with the VSL Service Center project structure:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Frontend Structure">
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>`src/Component/` - Main component directory</li>
      <li>`src/Routes/` - React Router configuration</li>
      <li>`src/Component/ui/` - Reusable UI components</li>
      <li>`src/Component/Login/` - Authentication components</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Key Components to Migrate">
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>`App.js` - Main application component</li>
      <li>`Navbar.js` - Navigation component</li>
      <li>`LandingPage.js` - Home page component</li>
      <li>`ui/Card.jsx` - Reusable card component</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Routing Structure">
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Current React Router setup</li>
      <li>Route definitions and navigation</li>
      <li>Protected routes and authentication</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Migration Strategy

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Component Migration Order" icon="list">
    <ol>
      <li>UI components first (no dependencies)</li>
      <li>Layout components second</li>
      <li>Business logic components last</li>
      <li>Authentication components</li>
    </ol>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Routing Migration" icon="route">
    <ol>
      <li>Analyze current route structure</li>
      <li>Map to Next.js file-based routing</li>
      <li>Implement layouts and templates</li>
      <li>Update navigation components</li>
    </ol>
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Create new Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Key File Patterns

```
app/
├── layout.tsx          # Root layout
├── page.tsx            # Home page
├── loading.tsx         # Loading UI
├── error.tsx           # Error boundary
├── not-found.tsx       # 404 page
├── template.tsx        # Template (optional)
└── (auth)/             # Route group
    ├── layout.tsx      # Auth layout
    ├── login/
    │   └── page.tsx    # Login page
    └── register/
        └── page.tsx    # Register page
```

### Component Patterns

```typescript
// Server Component (default)
export default function ServerComponent() {
  return <div>Server rendered content</div>;
}

// Client Component
("use client");

import { useState } from "react";

export default function ClientComponent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState("");
  return <div>Interactive content</div>;
}
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Component Not Rendering">
**Problem**: Component not showing up after migration
**Solution**: Check file naming (`page.tsx` for routes), verify imports, ensure proper component export
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Routing Issues">
  **Problem**: Routes not working as expected **Solution**: Verify file
  structure matches desired URL structure, check for typos in folder names
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Client Component Errors">
  **Problem**: "use client" directive not working **Solution**: Ensure directive
  is at the very top of the file, check for any code before the directive
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Layout Not Applying">
**Problem**: Layout styles not showing
**Solution**: Verify layout.tsx is in correct directory, ensure it wraps children properly
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
