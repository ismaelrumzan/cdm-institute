title: "Module 8: Tool Integration and Multi-Step Reasoning"
description: "Implement AI tools for extending agent capabilities. Create multi-step reasoning with tool chaining and handle tool execution."
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement AI tools for extending agent capabilities
- Create multi-step reasoning with tool chaining
- Design tool schemas and validation
- Handle tool execution and result processing

## Module Overview

This module focuses on extending your RAG agent with AI tools that can perform specific actions. You'll implement tools for adding resources and retrieving information, enabling your agent to take actions beyond just responding to queries.
