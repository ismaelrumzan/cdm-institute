## Understanding RAG

<WhatIsRag />

## Why RAG Matters

Traditional large language models have a significant limitation: they can only work with the information they were trained on. This creates several problems:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Knowledge Cutoff" icon="calendar">
    Models can't access information after their training date
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Personal Data" icon="user">
    Models can't access your private or proprietary information
  </Card>
</Columns>
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hallucinations" icon="cloud">
    Models may make up information when they don't know the answer
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limited Context" icon="database">
    Models can't access real-time or domain-specific data
  </Card>
</Columns>

### The RAG Solution

RAG addresses these limitations by:

<Steps>
  <Step title="External Knowledge Access">
    RAG systems can retrieve information from external sources like databases,
    documents, and APIs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Real-time Information">
    RAG can access current information that wasn't available during model
    training
  </Step>
  <Step title="Domain-specific Knowledge">
    RAG can incorporate specialized knowledge for specific industries or use
    cases
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reduced Hallucinations">
    By providing relevant context, RAG reduces the likelihood of the model
    making up information
  </Step>
</Steps>

## RAG Architecture Overview

RAG solves these problems by following a specific process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Query">A user asks a question or makes a request</Step>
  <Step title="Query Processing">
    The system processes the query and identifies what information is needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Information Retrieval">
    Relevant information is retrieved from external sources (documents,
    databases, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Context Augmentation">
    The retrieved information is added to the user's query as context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response Generation">
    The language model generates a response using both the original query and
    the retrieved context
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Examples

RAG systems are transforming how organizations handle information and provide services. Here are detailed examples of RAG in action:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Customer Support & Help Desks">
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Traditional Approach" icon="user">
    Support agents manually search through documentation and knowledge bases,
    leading to inconsistent responses and longer resolution times.
  </Card>
  <Card title="RAG-Enhanced Support" icon="books">
    AI assistant instantly retrieves relevant information from company knowledge
    base, providing accurate, up-to-date answers with source citations.
  </Card>
</Columns>

**Real Example**: A customer asks "How do I reset my password?". The RAG system searches through the company's support documentation, finds the specific password reset procedure, and provides step-by-step instructions with links to relevant articles.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Research & Academic Applications">
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Manual Research" icon="search">
    Researchers spend hours manually searching through papers, reading
    abstracts, and cross-referencing citations to find relevant information.
  </Card>
  <Card title="RAG Research Assistant" icon="book">
    AI assistant searches through thousands of papers, identifies relevant
    studies, and provides summaries with direct citations and key findings.
  </Card>
</Columns>

**Real Example**: A researcher asks "What are the latest developments in transformer architecture?" The RAG system searches through recent papers, identifies key innovations, and provides a synthesized summary with links to the original research.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Legal & Compliance">
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Manual Document Review" icon="file-text">
    Lawyers manually search through case law, regulations, and legal documents,
    which is time-consuming and prone to missing relevant precedents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="RAG Legal Assistant" icon="scale">
    AI assistant searches through legal databases, finds relevant cases and
    regulations, and provides context-aware legal guidance with citations.
  </Card>
</Columns>

**Real Example**: A lawyer asks "What are the precedents for data privacy violations in healthcare?" The RAG system searches through case law, finds relevant precedents, and provides analysis with specific case citations and outcomes.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Healthcare & Medical">
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Traditional Diagnosis" icon="stethoscope">
    Doctors rely on memory and manual searches through medical literature, which
    can lead to missed information or outdated practices.
  </Card>
  <Card title="RAG Medical Assistant" icon="heart">
    AI assistant searches through medical literature, clinical guidelines, and
    patient records to provide evidence-based recommendations.
  </Card>
</Columns>

**Real Example**: A doctor asks "What are the latest treatment protocols for diabetes management?" The RAG system searches through medical journals, clinical guidelines, and recent studies to provide current best practices with supporting evidence.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Enterprise Knowledge Management">
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Scattered Information" icon="folder">
    Company knowledge is spread across multiple systems, making it difficult for
    employees to find relevant information quickly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="RAG Knowledge Hub" icon="database">
    Centralized AI assistant that searches across all company systems and
    provides relevant information with source attribution.
  </Card>
</Columns>

**Real Example**: An employee asks "What's our policy on remote work?" The RAG system searches through HR documents, company policies, and recent announcements to provide the most current and relevant information.

## Interactive Elements

### Before vs After RAG

Let's explore the dramatic difference between traditional LLMs and RAG-enhanced systems:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Traditional LLM Response">
    - **Question**: What's the latest news about AI?
    - **Process with prompt**: `await model.generate({ prompt: "What's the latest news about AI?" });`
    - **Response**: Based on my training data, AI has made significant progress in areas like machine learning and natural language processing. However, I don't have access to current events beyond my training cutoff date.
  </Card>
  <Card title="RAG-Enhanced Response">
    - **Question**: What's the latest news about AI?
    - **Process with retrieval**: `await retrieveRelevantDocuments("latest AI news");`
    - **Process with prompt using retrieved context**:  `await model.generate({ prompt: ``Based on this context: ${relevantDocs}\n\nWhat's the latest news about AI?`` });`
    - **Response**: According to recent reports, OpenAI has released GPT-4 Turbo with improved performance and reduced costs. Google has also announced new developments in their Gemini model. These updates represent significant advances in AI capabilities and accessibility.
