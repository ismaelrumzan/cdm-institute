title: "Module 3: Database Schema and Data Modeling"
description: "Understand the existing database schemas in the starter project. Implement vector storage with proper indexing and set up database migrations."
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the existing database schemas in the starter project
- Implement vector storage with proper indexing
- Understand foreign key relationships and data integrity
- Set up database migrations and version control

## Module Overview

This module focuses on the database layer of your RAG application. You'll explore the existing schema, add vector storage capabilities, and understand how to properly structure your data for efficient retrieval and storage.
