   - Performance optimization

3. **Data Fetching Strategies**

   - Server actions
   - API routes
   - Database integration patterns
   - Caching strategies

4. **Deployment and DevOps**

   - CI/CD with GitHub Actions
   - Environment management
   - Performance monitoring

#### Step 5: Analyze Cognitive Strategies

**Expert Problem-Solving Approaches**:

1. **Migration Strategy**

   - Start with static components
   - Identify client-side dependencies
   - Plan data fetching migration
   - Test incrementally

2. **Architecture Decisions**

   - Evaluate component complexity
   - Choose appropriate rendering strategy
   - Plan state management approach
   - Consider performance implications

3. **Troubleshooting Approach**
   - Use Next.js development tools
   - Leverage browser dev tools
   - Check server logs
   - Test in isolation

#### Step 6: Analyze Mental Models

**Domain Organization**:

1. **Application Architecture**

   ```
   Frontend (Next.js) ←→ API Routes ←→ Database
        ↓
   Vercel Deployment ←→ CI/CD ←→ Monitoring
   ```

2. **Component Hierarchy**

   ```
   App Router
   ├── Layouts
   ├── Pages
   ├── Components
   │   ├── Server Components
   │   └── Client Components
   └── API Routes
   ```

3. **Data Flow**
   ```
   User Action → Server Action → Database
        ↓
   Response → Component Update → UI Render
   ```

### Steps 7-9: Procedural Information (Routine Aspects)

#### Step 7: Design Procedural Information

**Just-in-Time Procedures**:

1. **Component Migration Checklist**

   - [ ] Identify component type (server/client)
   - [ ] Remove client-side only code
   - [ ] Update imports and exports
   - [ ] Test component functionality
   - [ ] Update routing if needed

2. **API Route Creation**

   - [ ] Create route file in app/api/
   - [ ] Define HTTP method handler
   - [ ] Implement error handling

3. **Deployment Process**
   - [ ] Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
   - [ ] Configure environment variables
   - [ ] Set up build settings
   - [ ] Deploy and test
   - [ ] Configure custom domain

#### Step 8: Analyze Cognitive Rules

**IF-THEN Rules for Routine Tasks**:

- **IF** component uses useState/useEffect **THEN** mark as client component
- **IF** component needs browser APIs **THEN** use client component
- **IF** data fetching is needed **THEN** use server actions or API routes
- **IF** deployment fails **THEN** check build logs and environment variables
- **IF** performance is slow **THEN** analyze bundle size and optimize
