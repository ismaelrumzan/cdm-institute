### Your Learning Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Module 1-3: Foundation">
    Set up the development environment, database schema, and embedding pipeline
  </Step>
  <Step title="Module 4: Frontend & API">
    Built the chat interface and configured API routes with system prompts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Module 5: AI Tools">
    Implemented intelligent tools for adding resources and retrieving
    information
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Technical Achievements

1. **Tool Implementation**: Created two essential tools:

   - `addResource`: Automatically adds and embeds user-provided information
   - `getInformation`: Retrieves relevant content using semantic search

2. **Embedding Pipeline**: Built a robust system for:

   - Generating embeddings from text content
   - Storing vectors in your database
   - Performing similarity searches

3. **AI Integration**: Configured the AI model to:

   - Automatically select appropriate tools
   - Process tool results intelligently
   - Provide contextual responses

4. **User Experience**: Enhanced the interface to:

   - Display tool calls transparently
   - Show tool execution states
   - Provide confirmation and context
