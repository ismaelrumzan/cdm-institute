## What You'll Build

Throughout this program, you'll build a production-ready RAG chatbot using the official Vercel AI SDK RAG starter. You'll learn to ingest documents, create vector embeddings, implement semantic search, and generate contextually relevant responses using OpenAI's models.

## Learning Outcomes

- Build production-ready RAG chatbots using Vercel AI SDK
- Understand vector embeddings and semantic search
- Implement document ingestion and processing pipelines
- Create responsive chat interfaces with streaming
- Deploy and scale AI applications on Vercel
- Integrate PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector storage
