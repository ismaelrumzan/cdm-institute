## Takeaways

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Start the Next.js development server
- Test the basic application functionality
- Verify that your database and environment are working correctly
- Understand the current application structure

## Start the Development Server

Now that you have your database and environment variables configured, let's start the development server and test your application.

<Steps>

<Step title="Start the server">

<Info>
  **Multiple terminals**: If you have Drizzle Studio running in your current
  terminal, create a new terminal tab/window to run the development server. This
  allows both services to run simultaneously for local development.
</Info>

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dev
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Check for success">

You should see output similar to:

```bash Terminal
  ▲ Next.js 14.2.4
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env

 ✓ Starting...
 ✓ Ready in 1464ms
```

</Step>

<Step title="Access the application">

1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see the application homepage that says:

<Note>Hello, world!</Note>

</Step>

</Steps>

<Info>
  **Development URL**: The application will be available at
  `http://localhost:3000`
</Info>

<Info>
  **Hot Reload**: Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh
  the browser
</Info>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Development server won't start">

**Common solutions:**

1. **Check port conflicts** - Ensure port 3000 is not in use by another application
2. **Verify dependencies** - Run `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed
3. **Check environment variables** - Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root
4. **Check Node.js version** - Ensure you're using Node.js 18 or higher

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Database connection errors">

**Check these items:**

1. **Verify DATABASE_URL** - Ensure your connection string is correct in `.env`
2. **Check database status** - Verify your Vercel/Neon database is active
3. **Test connection** - Try running `npm run db:studio` to test database connectivity
4. **Check migrations** - Ensure you ran `npm run db:migrate` successfully

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build or compilation errors">

**Solutions:**

1. **TypeScript errors** - Check for missing dependencies or type definitions
2. **Import errors** - Ensure all required packages are installed
3. **Syntax errors** - Check for any syntax issues in your code
4. **Clear cache** - Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again

</Accordion>
