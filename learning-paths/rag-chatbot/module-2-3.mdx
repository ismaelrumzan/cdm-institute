## Start the Development Server

Now that you have your database and environment variables configured, let's start the development server and test your application.

<Steps>

<Step title="Start the server">

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dev
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Check for success">

You should see output similar to:

```bash Terminal
- ready started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
- event compiled client and server successfully
```

</Step>

<Step title="Access the application">

1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see the application homepage

</Step>

</Steps>

<Info>
  **Development URL**: The application will be available at
  `http://localhost:3000`
</Info>

<Info>
  **Hot Reload**: Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh
  the browser
</Info>

## Test Basic Functionality

Let's verify that your setup is working correctly by testing the core features.

<Steps>

<Step title="Test Resource Addition">

1. Look for a section to add resources or knowledge base content
2. Add a simple test resource (e.g., "This is a test document about AI and machine learning")
3. Submit the form
4. Verify that the resource appears in the list

<Info>
  **What this tests**: Database connectivity and basic CRUD operations
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Test Chat Interface">

1. Find the chat interface on the page
2. Send a simple message like "Hello" or "What can you help me with?"
3. Check that you receive a response from the AI

<Info>
  **What this tests**: OpenAI API connectivity and basic chat functionality
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Check for Errors">

1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for any error messages
3. Check the Network tab for failed API requests
4. Look at your terminal for any server-side errors

</Step>

</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Note**: The chat may not have RAG functionality yet - that's what we'll
  build in the coming modules. For now, it should respond with general AI
  responses.
</Warning>

## Using Drizzle Studio (Optional)

You can also explore your database using Drizzle Studio to verify that data is being stored correctly.

<Steps>

<Step title="Start Drizzle Studio">

In a new terminal window, run:

```bash Terminal
npm run db:studio
```

</Step>

<Step title="Access the interface">

1. Navigate to the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:4983`)
2. You should see your database tables and data

</Step>

<Step title="Verify data">

1. Look for the `resources` table
2. Check that any resources you added are visible
3. Verify the table structure matches the schema

</Step>

</Steps>

<Info>
  **Drizzle Studio**: A web interface for viewing and managing your database
  tables and data
</Info>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Development server won't start">

**Common solutions:**

1. **Check port conflicts** - Ensure port 3000 is not in use by another application
2. **Verify dependencies** - Run `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed
3. **Check environment variables** - Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root
4. **Check Node.js version** - Ensure you're using Node.js 18 or higher

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Database connection errors">

**Check these items:**

1. **Verify DATABASE_URL** - Ensure your connection string is correct in `.env`
2. **Check database status** - Verify your Vercel/Neon database is active
3. **Test connection** - Try running `npm run db:studio` to test database connectivity
4. **Check migrations** - Ensure you ran `npm run db:migrate` successfully

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="OpenAI API errors">

**Common issues:**

1. **Invalid API key** - Ensure your OpenAI API key is correct and starts with `sk-`
2. **Account issues** - Check that your OpenAI account has credits and is not suspended
3. **Rate limits** - Ensure you haven't exceeded your API usage limits
4. **Network issues** - Check your internet connection

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build or compilation errors">

**Solutions:**

1. **TypeScript errors** - Check for missing dependencies or type definitions
2. **Import errors** - Ensure all required packages are installed
3. **Syntax errors** - Check for any syntax issues in your code
4. **Clear cache** - Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Application Structure Overview

Your application should now have the following basic structure:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Frontend" icon="monitor">
    - Next.js application with React components - Chat interface for user
    interaction - Resource management interface
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backend" icon="server">
    - API routes for chat functionality - Database operations with Drizzle ORM -
    OpenAI integration for AI responses
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Database" icon="database">
    - PostgreSQL with pgvector extension - Resources table for knowledge base -
    Migration system for schema management
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environment" icon="settings">
    - Environment variables for configuration - API keys for external services -
    Database connection strings
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Reflection Questions

Take a moment to reflect on what you've learned:

1. **How does the development environment support rapid iteration?**

   - Consider hot reload and development tools
   - Think about debugging capabilities

2. **What role does the database play in the current application?**

   - Consider data persistence and storage
   - Think about the relationship between frontend and backend

3. **How does the current setup prepare you for RAG functionality?**
   - Consider the existing infrastructure
   - Think about what components are already in place

---

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your development environment and verified that everything is working. In the next module, you'll:

- **Understand the database schema** and existing table structure
- **Add vector storage capabilities** to support embeddings
- **Implement database migrations** for the enhanced schema

Ready to continue? Proceed to [Module 3: Database Schema and Data Modeling](/learning-paths/rag-chatbot/module-3-home).

<Callout>
  **Key Takeaway**: A working development environment with proper database
  connectivity and API integration provides the foundation for building advanced
  RAG functionality.
