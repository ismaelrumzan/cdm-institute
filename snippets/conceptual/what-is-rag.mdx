<Card title="What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?" icon="lightbulb">

RAG is a technique that enhances language models by providing them with relevant external information during generation. Instead of relying solely on training data, RAG systems can access and reason over up-to-date information from knowledge bases, documents, or databases.

## The RAG Process

1. Retrieval: Find relevant documents or information based on the user's query
2. Augmentation: Combine the retrieved information with the original query
3. Generation: Use a language model to generate a response using both sources
