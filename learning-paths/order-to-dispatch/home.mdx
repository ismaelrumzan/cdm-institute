## Key Prompting Techniques Summary

### 1. **Progressive Feature Building**

Each prompt builds upon the previous one, adding new functionality to the existing system rather than starting from scratch.

### 2. **Iterative Development**

Break complex features into smaller, manageable prompts that can be implemented and tested incrementally.

### 3. **Integration Focus**

Each prompt emphasizes connecting new features with existing systems and maintaining consistency.

### 4. **AI Integration Patterns**

Use structured prompts to integrate AI capabilities into business workflows effectively.

## Prompting Best Practices

### **Start Simple, Build Complexity**

- Begin with basic functionality
- Add advanced features incrementally
- Test each addition before moving forward

### **Maintain Consistency**

- Reference existing systems in each prompt
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Ensure UI/UX consistency across modules

### **Focus on Integration**

- Always connect new features to existing systems
- Maintain data relationships and workflows
- Ensure proper error handling and validation

### **Plan for Scale**

- Design for enterprise-level usage
- Consider performance and optimization
- Implement proper security measures
