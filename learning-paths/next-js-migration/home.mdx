title: "Next.js Migration Mastery: From Legacy React to Modern Web Applications"
description: "Master the complete migration of enterprise React applications to Next.js with App Router. Learn to modernize VSL Service Center and API systems while mastering deployment, performance optimization, and production-ready practices."
---

## What You'll Build

Throughout this program, you'll migrate a real enterprise warehouse management system (VSL Service Center) from Create React App to Next.js with App Router. You'll modernize the backend API, implement modern data fetching patterns, and deploy the complete system to production on Vercel.

<Callout>
  This learning path is designed for developers familiar with React and
  JavaScript, but new to Next.js App Router, modern deployment practices, and
  enterprise-scale application migration. No prior Next.js experience is
  required.
</Callout>

## Learning Outcomes

- **Migrate complex React applications** from Create React App to Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Modernize backend APIs** and implement seamless frontend-backend integration
- **Master modern data fetching patterns** including Server Actions, API Routes, and caching strategies
- **Deploy production-ready applications** on Vercel with CI/CD and monitoring
- **Implement performance optimizations** and best practices for enterprise applications
- **Handle real-world complexity** including authentication, file uploads, and database integration
