## 1.1 What is RAG and Why It Matters

**Duration**: 25 minutes

### Understanding RAG

<WhatIsRag />

### Why RAG Matters

Traditional large language models have a significant limitation: they can only work with the information they were trained on. This creates several problems:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Knowledge Cutoff" icon="calendar">
    Models can't access information after their training date
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Personal Data" icon="user">
    Models can't access your private or proprietary information
  </Card>
</Columns>
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hallucinations" icon="warning">
    Models may make up information when they don't know the answer
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limited Context" icon="database">
    Models can't access real-time or domain-specific data
  </Card>
</Columns>

### RAG Architecture Overview

RAG solves these problems by following a specific process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. User Query">A user asks a question or makes a request</Step>
  <Step title="2. Query Processing">
    The system processes the query and identifies what information is needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Information Retrieval">
    Relevant information is retrieved from external sources (documents,
    databases, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Context Augmentation">
    The retrieved information is added to the user's query as context
  </Step>
  <Step title="5. Response Generation">
    The language model generates a response using both the original query and
    the retrieved context
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 1.2 Embeddings Deep Dive: Vector Space and Similarity

**Duration**: 35 minutes

### Understanding Embeddings

<VectorEmbeddings />

### Vector Space Concepts

Embeddings represent text as vectors in a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned close together:

<MDXImage
  srcLight="/images/vector-space-light.png"
  srcDark="/images/vector-space-dark.png"
  width={600}
  height={400}
  alt="Vector Space Representation"
/>

### Similarity Metrics

The most common way to measure similarity between embeddings is **cosine similarity**:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="Cosine Similarity Formula">
    ```python similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||) ```
  </CodeGroupItem>
  <CodeGroupItem title="Example Calculation">
    ```python # Example vectors vector_a = [0.5, 0.8, 0.2] vector_b = [0.6, 0.7,
    0.3] # Cosine similarity ranges from -1 to 1 # 1 = identical, 0 = unrelated,
    -1 = opposite ```
  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

### Interactive Similarity Calculator

<Callout>
  **Try it yourself**: Use our interactive similarity calculator to see how
  different words relate to each other in vector space.
</Callout>

| Word Pair           | Expected Similarity  | Reasoning                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "cat" vs "dog"      | High (0.8-0.9)       | Both are pets, animals        |
| "cat" vs "computer" | Low (0.1-0.3)        | Unrelated concepts            |
| "happy" vs "joyful" | Very High (0.9+)     | Synonyms                      |
| "happy" vs "sad"    | Low/Medium (0.3-0.5) | Related but opposite emotions |

### Chunking Strategies

When working with long documents, we need to break them into smaller pieces (chunks) for effective embedding:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sentence-based Chunking" icon="text">
    Split by sentences or paragraphs. Good for narrative content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Token-based Chunking" icon="hash">
    Split by token count. Good for consistent chunk sizes.
  </Card>
</Columns>
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Semantic Chunking" icon="brain">
    Split by meaning boundaries. Most sophisticated approach.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fixed-size Chunking" icon="ruler">
    Split into equal-sized pieces. Simple but may break context.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Chunking Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Maintain Context">
    Ensure chunks contain enough context to be meaningful on their own
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Avoid Breaking Sentences">
    Don't split in the middle of sentences or important phrases
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Consider Overlap">
    Use overlapping chunks to maintain continuity between pieces
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Size Appropriately">
    Balance chunk size with embedding quality and retrieval accuracy
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 1.3 Practical Exercise: Embedding Exploration

**Duration**: 20 minutes

### Exercise Overview

In this hands-on exercise, you'll explore embeddings using a simple playground to understand how they work in practice.

### Setup Instructions

<Snippet text="npm install -g @ai-sdk/playground" />

### Exercise Tasks

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Generate Embeddings">
    Create embeddings for different types of text: - Short phrases: "machine
    learning", "artificial intelligence" - Sentences: "The weather is sunny
    today", "It's raining outside" - Paragraphs: A short story or article
    excerpt
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Compare Similarities">
    Calculate similarity scores between: - Related concepts (e.g., "car" vs
    "automobile") - Unrelated concepts (e.g., "car" vs "philosophy") - Opposite
    concepts (e.g., "hot" vs "cold")
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Experiment with Chunking">
    Try different chunking strategies on a longer text: - Split by sentences -
    Split by fixed character count - Split by semantic boundaries
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Expected Results

You should observe:

- **High similarity** (0.7-0.9) for related concepts
- **Low similarity** (0.1-0.3) for unrelated concepts
- **Medium similarity** (0.4-0.6) for concepts that are related but not identical

### Reflection Questions

<Callout type="warning">
  Take a moment to reflect on these questions before moving to the next module:
</Callout>

1. **How does chunk size affect embedding quality?**

   - What happens when chunks are too small?
   - What happens when chunks are too large?

2. **What types of content would benefit most from RAG?**

   - Consider different industries and use cases
   - Think about content that changes frequently

3. **How would you design a chunking strategy for your specific use case?**
   - What factors would you consider?
   - How would you test and validate your approach?

### Next Steps
