## Get started

To set up the repository on your local machine, follow these steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Clone the Repository">

- Open your terminal and navigate to where you want to create the project

```bash title="Terminal"
cd ~/{your-development-directory}
```

- Clone the repository

```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/vercel/ai-sdk-rag-starter.git
```

- Navigate into the project directory

```bash title="Terminal"
cd ai-sdk-rag-starter
```

</Step>

<Step title="Install dependencies">

Install Node.js dependencies and check for any errors in the console:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Activity: Explore the Codebase with Cursor

Now that you have the repository set up, let's explore the codebase using Cursor's AI-powered features to understand the project structure and purpose.

<Steps>

<Step title="Open the repository in Cursor">

You can open the repository in Cursor in two ways:

**Option 1: Using the command line**

```bash Terminal
cd ai-sdk-rag-starter
cursor .
```

**Option 2: Using the file menu**

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to `File` → `Open Folder`
3. Navigate to and select the `ai-sdk-rag-starter` folder
4. Click `Open`

</Step>

<Step title="Add the repository to Cursor Chat">

1. In the file explorer (left sidebar), right-click on the root folder `ai-sdk-rag-starter`
2. Select `Add to Cursor Chat` from the context menu
3. This will add the entire repository to your chat context

</Step>

<Step title="Add the README to Cursor Chat">

1. In the file explorer, find and right-click on the `README.md` file
2. Select `Add to Cursor Chat` from the context menu
3. This will add the README documentation to your chat context

</Step>

<Step title="Ask Cursor to analyze the codebase">

In the Cursor Chat panel, ask the following prompt:

```
Review the code in this repository and explain its purpose and how the code is structured
```

<Info>
  **What to expect**: Cursor will analyze the entire codebase and provide you:
  <ul>
    <li>An overview of the project's purpose</li>
    <li>Explanation of the main components and their relationships</li>
    <li>Code structure and architecture patterns</li>
    <li>Key files and their roles in the application</li>
  </ul>
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Explore further (optional)">

Once you have the initial analysis, you can ask follow-up questions like:

- `How does the RAG functionality work in this codebase?`
- `What database schema is being used?`
- `What are the main React components and their purposes?`

</Step>

<Step title="Save the analysis">

1. In the Cursor Chat panel, click the `Export chat` button
2. Save the analysis to a file named `codebase-analysis.md`
3. Paste the results in a slack message to the course channel

</Step>

</Steps>

<Info>
  **Learning Tip**: This activity helps you understand the codebase from an AI
  perspective, which can reveal patterns and relationships you might miss when
  reading the code manually. Use this as a foundation for the hands-on
  development work in the upcoming modules.
