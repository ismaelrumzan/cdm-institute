## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Module 1: Next.js Foundation & Project Setup
- Understanding of RESTful API concepts
- Basic knowledge of SQL and database operations
- Familiarity with JWT authentication concepts
- Access to the VSL-Api codebase

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**: Keep your database connection strings and API keys secure. Use
  environment variables for all sensitive configuration data.
